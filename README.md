I am creating this node website in part with a guide. I decided to modify it further after the initial tutorial portion was complete.

This will become a boilerplate node project for local clients wanting smaller non-cms sites. It will allow me to spin up a project quickly and then spend most of my time choosing which third party applications to incorporate to meet the functionality needs of the client while reducing the bloat associated with many frameworks.
